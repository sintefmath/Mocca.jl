# Mocca

Mocca [Mocca.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/Mocca.jl) provides a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) based framework for the simulating pressure / temperature swing adsorption processes for CO2 capture.

Currently there is an implementation of a 4-stage vacuum swing adsorption process for CO2 capture, from a two-component flue gas, using Zeolite 13X and a dual-site Langmuir model. See [Direct Column Breakthrough simulation](@ref) and [Cyclic Vacuum Swing Adsorption simulation](@ref).

In the future we hope to implement examples of other systems and isotherms e.g. temperature swing adsorption for Direct Air Capture (DAC).
